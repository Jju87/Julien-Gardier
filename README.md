## Structure

- Hero Header
- About Me
- Skills
- Portfolio
- Contact

## Technologies Used

- React
- SCSS
- HTML
- Yarn

## Additional Features

- The site is available in English and French.
- No packages are used for modals or layout. The contact form uses email.js for handling email submissions, and to avoid bots, I've implemented reCAPTCHA v2.
- Even if it has been modified to fit my project, the card animation in my portfolio was inspired by this video by Hyperplexed: [ImNotGoodEnough.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TYkDy54q4E).
- When you click on one of my projects, a modal containing a project description opens. Additionally, an integrated iframe window allows visitors to navigate through one of my projects without leaving the portfolio.

Enjoy your visit!
